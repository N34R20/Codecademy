 the cut is flattering, and may not need a bra (i am droppy, but it was fine). the legs are wide enough that one time, i had both legs in one hole, so-to-speak, and it is very flowy. the patterns are both nice, i like the geometric one, but the polka dot is always a classic. the petite size fit me just right (xsp) at 115 lbs, 30dd. i like the tie it goes from around the cups to tie on the back, so you can almost ti",True,General,Dresses,2019-07-08,Liked it

993,53,Nice addition to everyday wardrobe...,"This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i",True,General Petite,Bottoms,2019-05-14,Liked it
